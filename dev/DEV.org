#+TITLE: newm developer information

* Current (v0.3)

** TODO Update wlroots

** Bugs
**** WAIT FocusBorder (possibly SSD as well) sometimes shows up before newm closes (after fade-out animation has finished)
**** WAIT Screenshare crashes on chrome
**** WAIT Issues on wakeup with login managers

** Improvements
*** TODO Diagonal movements (kebindings)
*** TODO Clean-up state validation logic, e.g.: When rescaling a window which results in a different viewpoint afterwards, this adjustment is only triggered after releasing Mod
*** TODO Update focus after animation / gesture
*** TODO Configurable locking behaviour (blur, dim, squish) - don't expose texture_shaders as config option
 
* Backlog
** Stacked windows: Place them in a grid or similar (configurable)
** Slide in top and bottom bars
** NixOS greetd deployment including documentation
** Small improvements
    - Hide cursor automativally
    - Switch to last focused window (i.e. make switching between two windows via one shortcut possible)
    - Don't have double padding between windows
    * Ultrawide monitors --> two workspaces on one output
    - Layer shell - Exclusive zones and keyboard interactivity
    - Move to resize overlay: Trigger size changes on invisible windows only in finish transition? Analogous to interpolate
    - Move tiles from workspace to another -> animate size change instead of jump
    - Autoplace the first couple of windows more like i3 (i.e. resizing existing windows / tiling)
    - Scale windows moving others "out of the way"

** rofi / dmenu app-switcher via newm-cmd
** scratchpad
** dbus endpoint for waybar etc
** Support swaylock
** Titles during Overview
** More detailed config on Layout class
** Ability to increase size of rows or cols (e.g. in 1x2 | 1x2)
** Allow certain overlays to start during animations (e.g. 3/4-Finger-Swipe during animation one view)
** Dynamic background
** Possible and sensible to use a decorator for layout methods where reducer is defined and then an animation is started?
** Video on newm-sidecar
** Move all configurable debug options into `debug.xyz = True`
